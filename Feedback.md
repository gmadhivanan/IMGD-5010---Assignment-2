## Adryen's attempt at instructions:


Creating Your Hero:

Since our illustration medium works in layers, we need to make the layers in order starting from the bottom most layer. 
We will create all of our elements starting with our background (BG) and then continuing with all of the shapes that we will need to illustrate your hero!
Once we have created all of our shapes, we will finally assemble our hero!


First: 
Create a teal-colored square as your background (BG).


Create the Shapes in Layer Order:

Then:
Create two caramel-colored rectangles.
These will be our hero's legs. 

Remember, since we are building in layers you will want to make sure we start with the bottom most shapes.


Create a lime-green-colored rectangle, it should be larger than the legs and will act as the primary shape of the hero's body. 


Create either a lime-green-colored trapezoid or triangle and place it on top of the lime-green-colored rectangle that you previously made to ensure that the bottom end of the trapezoid/triangle is the same size as the tope of the lime-green-colored rectangle.


Create a reddish-cream-like-flesh-tone-colored circle, this will be the hero's face. 

Create two caramel-colored rectangles, these will be the hero's eyes. 

Create two lime-green-colored squares, these will be the accents on the hero's eyes. 

Create a larger caramel-colored rectangle, this will be the hero's mouth. 

Create a lime-green-colored trapezoid and place it on top of the circle that makes up the hero's face, it is best if the edges line-up or go a little bit over the size of the circle, this will be the hero's hat. 
Note: If you used a trapezoid instead of a triangle for the top of the body, you may be able to duplicate the shape and use it as the hero's hat!


Create a caramel-colored trapezoid that fits within the lime-green-colored trapezoid of the hat, this will be the hero's hair. 


Create two long thin, but not too thin caramel-colored trapezoids, these will be the hero's arms. 


Create a long thin caramel-colored rectangle or line with a heavy stroke weight, it should be no longer than the lime-green-colored rectangle you created for the body, this will be the hero's belt. 

Create a caramel-colored square, this will be the hero's belt buckle. 

Create a reddish-cream-like-flesh-tone-colored triangle, this will be the item that the hero holds above them.
 
Create two reddish-cream-like-flesh-tone-colored squares, these will be the hands. 


Assemble the Shapes:

Now that you have all of the shapes made you can begin to assemble!

Start by positioning all of the shapes near to or in the center of your BG. 


The two caramel colored rectangles we made as the legs should ground the character, so place them where you would like the hero to stand. 

Adjust the elements until you are satisfied with the look of your hero or use the reference image to emulate the shape placement shown there.
